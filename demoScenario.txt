Setup:
> A table. Paper with QR code is attached to the table.
> Arvydas at computer and clicking 'restaurant part'.
> Jurgis with mobile phone. It MUST be mirrored on the big screen!
The best option would be to have a split screen (half of the screen shows restaurant, half - my mobile phone).
If that's not possible/does not fit - then it's tab switching with AltTab.

Demo scenario:

  1. Arvydas (restaurant manager) opens up menu tab. Adds the item "ketchup". Everything else is already hardcoded there.
  2. Arvydas opens up branding tab. Changes the color.
3. I arrive at the restaurant and sit at the table (scan the QR).
4. I take a look at the menu. I choose 1 piece of "Leftover pizza" (2 euros) and 1 "Coca-Cola" (1 euro)
5. Special offer from chef Tom pops up: ketchup only for half the price (0.5euro). I take it.
6. I order and see the current status.
  7. Arvydas sees the order appear at "New" He puts it to "Current", then "Done".
8. The order is completed (Arvydas puts the pizza, coke and ketchup on the table where he stands. I come and pick it up).
9. Mention that the payment is done 'behind the scenes' (user adds credit card to the app)
